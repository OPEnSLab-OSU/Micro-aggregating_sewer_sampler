Compositing autosampler using weight based sampling targeted for sewage sampling in manholes. Code originally housed in 1232 branch of [SingleSampler repository](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/SingleSampler) and created using [Kawin Pechetratanapanit's sampler framework](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/OPEnSamplerFramework). Instructions for setting up PlatformIO within Visual Studio code are provided in the [OPEnSampler Framework Getting Started Guide](https://opensampler-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/start_here.html).
